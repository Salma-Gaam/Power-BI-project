# Data Analysis project - Interactive Dashboard

In this Data Analysis project, I have analyzed an online retailer's raw sales data using an intercative dashboard, that will help the company to draw meaningful insights into its sales performance and customers to build a strategy around it and generate more revenue with higher profits.

In this Dashboard, I tried to highlight some insights based on the following axes:
* Revenue per Region  
* Revenue based on the month of the year
* Revenue based on Age 
* Revenue of each Category
* Revenue of Category per gender
* Total units sold in the year (Oct 2020 - Oct 2021)
 
### Dashboard access
 If you have PowerBI desktop installed, download the 'sales performance analysis.pbix' from the repo and open it using PowerBI desktop. There is no need to download the raw dataset; the pbix files contain the complete normalized data model.
